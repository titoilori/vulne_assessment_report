Scenario
Cat’s Company Vulnerabilities

Cat needs your help providing critical information to the executive team to help them make decisions and preparations that uphold the security of the organization.

Now that you have completed the vulnerability assessment scan Cat has asked you to do, she has asked you to collect all the information to prioritize the vulnerabilities that were found from highest risk to lowest, and determine what information would be necessary for the executive team to make decisions and preparations to have them mitigated.

Cat wants to make sure the executive team has all the information they need, but she knows that they don’t have a lot of time. She has asked you to write a vulnerability assessment report on your findings that explains the issues you found, what is affected, what it might mean to the business, and what suggestions you recommend to fix the issues.

Cat will also need to make a presentation to the executive team about your report and recommendations, so she has asked you to create a five to seven minute briefing summarizing your report and recommendations for her to present.
